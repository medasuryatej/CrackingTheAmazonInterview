# CrackingTheAmazonInterview
A single stop for essential resources needed to crack Amazon Interview


Cracking the Amazon Interview.

How to Apply:

Referal
Contact recruiters or update your LinkedIn such that recrutiers reach out to you.
Apply on the Amazon Careers Page.
Preparation:
LeetCode - LeetCode - LeetCode.

[GOOD PREPARTION TIME]

Start doing medium problems, and pretty much stop doing Easy ones. Once you solve a question gothrough the solution tab to learn about other optimal implementations along with Space & Time Complexity.

Maintain a table of questions you solved /learnt from and quick logic for references.

Also do the prominent Hard problems. Trust me the learning from one hard question is much more than several ten's of easy problems.

Start participating in Weekly LeetCode contests, that preps you to solve easy to hard questions in a constrained timebox.

Good resource for intro to graphs: https://leetcode.com/discuss/topic/2360573

Be prepared with datastructure questions like Lists, Arrays, Strings, Tries, Priority Queues, Matrices, Trees. <br/>
Traversal questions like DFS, BFS, LevelOrder, SpiralOrder <br/>
Two pointer and Sliding Window questions <br/>
Sorting questions like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Topological Sort <br/>
Design questions like LRU Cache, O(1) Min Max Stack <br/>
Dependancy graph type questions like Course schedule <br/>
Graph questions related to Dijkstra, Prims, Kruskal, Bellman Ford, Union Find <br/>

Try to solve problems by looking at the constraints.
If the input constraint is >= 10^4 then O(N^2) solutions will give TLE. So try to find O(NLogN) or O(N) with memoization.
Recursive approaches could have result in maximum recursion depth or MLE errors, try to memozie or use Dynamic programming.

[SHORT PREPARTION TIME]
If you have a very tight schedule with upcoming interviews or starting with LeetCode, try the Blind75 (https://neetcode.io/practice), then NeetCode150.
NeetCode is a great youtube channel that teaches you the problem solving skills and code in Python.

Object Oriented Design:
Learn about Design Patterns (Creational, Structural and Behavioral) - https://www.oodesign.com/
LeetCode OOD Design tab is one great resource to know about the frequently asked OOD questions (https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/object-oriented-design?currentPage=1&orderBy=hot&query=)

System Design:
If you are new to system design, and like to learn about the various concepts https://designgurus.org/course/grokking-the-system-design-interview (Paid Course) is a good resource to start with. Github primer: https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer is a great free resource to learn from.

System Design Interview an Insider Guide by Alex xu (https://bytebytego.com/) is another fantastic resource

ACID Properties of Database
What are Loadbalancers?
What is Caching? what are the various caching techniques? Prominent Cache softwares
What are message queues?
What are APIs? REST vs SOAP vs gRPC, when to use which?

SystemDesignInterview - https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemDesignInterview
Design Data Intensive Applications is a great book for learning System Design at Scale

Gothrough the LeetCode discussion tabs for the most recently asked System Design questions.

Leadership Principles:
Amazon has 14 Leadership Principles (https://www.youtube.com/c/AmazonInterviewWhizzDayOneCareers). Every Amazonian is an embodiment of LPs which are used in every day decision making, coding a software even hiring an individual. So concentrate on LPs as much as you do LeetCode.

Good Resources:
CareerVidz - https://www.youtube.com/c/CareerVidz
AmazonInterviewWhizz - https://www.youtube.com/c/AmazonInterviewWhizzDayOneCareers

For each principle have 3 to 4 real life examples that you could articulate in the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action and Result)
